In the digital era, technology's rapid growth has led to a reliance on social media, potentially at the expense of face-to-face interaction and productivity. Consequently, studies show that social media distractions can significantly decrease productivity, making effective time management essential for optimal performance. To mitigate this, strategies such as daily journaling and active participation in workshops can substantially enhance communication skills, ultimately leading to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life.
